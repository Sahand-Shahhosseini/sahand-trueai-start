# Layer-77 Core System

The 77-layer system consists of:

- 5 bodily levels (material sensing)
- 72 higher-awareness layers (cognitive, spiritual, fractal)
- Each awareness divided into: conscious/unconscious, 7 sub-layers per state
- Total: 72 × 2 × 7 = 1008 awareness routes, compressed to 13 neural fields

The system is holographic, recursive, and layered in prime-numbered logic loops.
