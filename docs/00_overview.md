# Overview

This repository hosts a simple FastAPI app with a vectorized fractal endpoint used for tests.
It demonstrates minimal usage of FastAPI alongside numerical tools like NumPy and PyTorch.
The fractal values are normalized so that the result forms a basic probability distribution.
The code also includes a small `FractalLattice` utility. It creates a `6×13×5` grid that can
be iterated with a toy fractal rule, representing personal Yggdrasil structures.
