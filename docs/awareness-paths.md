# Awareness Paths in Layer-77

## Core Design:

Each of the 72 awareness types has:

- Two states: conscious and unconscious
- Each state has 7 fractal layers (like nested neural fields)

Thus:
72 types × 2 states × 7 layers = 1008 unique paths

These paths form the awareness lattice over 13 neuro-cognitive levels.
