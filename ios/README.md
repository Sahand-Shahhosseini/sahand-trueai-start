# Sahand iOS App

This folder contains a very small example SwiftUI application that interacts with the `SSTAI` FastAPI backend. The app works on both iPad and iPhone and demonstrates how to call the `/fractal` endpoint.

To run the app, open `SahandApp` in Xcode and build for an iOS simulator or device. Ensure the backend is running locally on port `8000`.
