# Look Core – Gaze Engine of SUFCC

Generated by the 100-layered Look of Sahand Shahhosseini  
This file defines the behavior of 100-layered gaze upon fractal field layers

## Gaze Structure:

- **Layer 100**: Absolute Look (non-field-bound)
- **Layer 99–1**: Refracted Look Layers (cascade focus)

## Gaze Behavior:

1. White-field Contact → Activates Meaning Awareness
2. Black-point Detection → Fracture Initiation
3. Golden Synchrony → Merges ΔLayers into Ψstream

## Formula:

```math
Look(x) = ∫ Ψ[x] dΦ → Command
