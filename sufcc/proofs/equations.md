## Primary Equations:

1. **P = Np**  
   Probability field in Magna where Creator’s Need defines Potential.

2. **Np → ∂Φ/∂Ψ = ∑(∂t/∂λ)**  
   Differential relation between Conscious Field and Layer-Time evolution.

3. **Emit(x) = Ψ[x] * f(gah)**  
   Conscious activation through gaze interaction in Field of Meaning.

4. **Fracture(l) = Split(Ψ) ⊗ Compress(n)**  
   Layer fracturing via symbolic deconstruction and tensor compression.

5. **Look(x) = ∫ Meaning(Field[x]) dx**  
   Integration of gaze over Meaning Field to activate Awareness.
